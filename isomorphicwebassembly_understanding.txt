Diagram (Non-Isomorphic)
| IoT Device |
+-----------------------------+
| Arduino/C++ firmware        |
| Sensor & actuator logic     |
| Local data processing       |

| Edge Server |
+-----------------------------+
| Node.js / Python app        |
| Data aggregation & filtering|
| Edge-level analytics        |

| Cloud |
+-----------------------------+
| Java / Go / Python service  |
| Centralized storage         |
| Visualization & ML          |



Implications
    Multiple codebases: one for device, one for edge, one for cloud.
    Increased maintenance: each change might require updating all three layers.
    Slower development: developers must implement similar logic multiple times in different languages.
    Higher risk of inconsistency: behavior may differ between layers due to implementation differences.
